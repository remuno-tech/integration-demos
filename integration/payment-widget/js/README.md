This project demonstrates pure javascript integration with the Remuno payment widget. To run the demo:

1. Load the `index.html` file in a browser. 
2. Provide an enabled widget API key from the merchant dashboard [Integration / Api](https://remuno.com/merchant/1/api-keys) page.
3. Provide your merchant ID from the [Account / Merchant profile](https://remuno.com/merchant/1/profile) page.
4. Click the `Checkout in Crypto` Remuno button to show the payment widget.
